# 🧠 Feature Engineering for Data Science & Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Feature Engineering** repository! This resource is dedicated to the art and science of transforming raw data into insightful features that improve the performance of machine learning models.

## 🚀 Why Feature Engineering?

Feature engineering is **where domain knowledge meets machine learning**. The right features can turn a mediocre model into a great one.

> “Better data beats fancier algorithms.” – Peter Norvig
